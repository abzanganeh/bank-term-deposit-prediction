# Project Enhancements Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the enhancements made to the Bank Term Deposit Prediction project. The original project included basic models (Naive Bayes and Decision Trees). The enhanced version adds advanced machine learning techniques while maintaining the existing codebase.

## What Was Added

### 1. Additional Machine Learning Models

**Random Forest**
- Ensemble of 100-300 decision trees
- Reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees
- Provides feature importance rankings
- Training time: 1-2 seconds

**XGBoost**
- Gradient boosting framework
- Excellent performance on structured data
- Built-in regularization to prevent overfitting
- Training time: < 1 second

**LightGBM**
- Fast gradient boosting implementation
- Memory efficient
- Often achieves best ROC-AUC scores
- Training time: < 1 second

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Finds optimal decision boundary
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Includes probability estimates
- Training time: 5+ minutes (slow on large datasets)

**Logistic Regression**
- Linear model baseline
- Interpretable coefficients
- Fast training and prediction
- Training time: 4-6 seconds

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning

Uses Optuna library for Bayesian optimization:

**How it works:**
1. Defines search space for each model's hyperparameters
2. Runs 10-20 trials with different parameter combinations
3. Each trial uses 3-fold cross-validation
4. Selects parameters that maximize ROC-AUC score
5. Trains final model with optimal parameters

**Models tuned:**
- Random Forest: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features
- XGBoost: n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample, colsample_bytree
- LightGBM: n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, subsample, colsample_bytree
- Logistic Regression: C (regularization), penalty, solver

**Typical improvements:**
- Random Forest: +0.5% ROC-AUC
- XGBoost: +0.4% ROC-AUC
- LightGBM: +0.1% ROC-AUC

### 3. Threshold Optimization

**Problem:** Default classification threshold is 0.5, but this may not be optimal

**Solution:**
1. Tests thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9 (in 0.01 steps)
2. Calculates precision, recall, F1-score at each threshold
3. Identifies best threshold for desired metric
4. Saves threshold for each model

**Example results:**
- XGBoost: Optimal threshold = 0.39 (F1-score improved from 0.55 to 0.60)
- LightGBM: Optimal threshold = 0.31 (balances precision and recall)

### 4. Model Stacking (Ensemble)

**Voting Classifier approach:**
1. Selects all models that can provide probability estimates
2. For each prediction:
   - Gets probability from each base model
   - Averages all probabilities (soft voting)
   - Makes final classification using averaged probability
3. Combines strengths of multiple models

**Base models used:**
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Logistic Regression

**Performance:**
- F1-Score: 58.15%
- ROC-AUC: 94.72%
- Often more stable than individual models

### 5. Advanced Evaluation Metrics

**Additional metrics calculated:**
- ROC-AUC: Measures discrimination ability (0-1 scale, higher is better)
- Average Precision: Summary of precision-recall curve
- Log Loss: Measures probability estimate quality

**New visualizations created:**
1. ROC curves comparison (shows discrimination for all models)
2. Precision-Recall curves (better for imbalanced data)
3. Calibration curves (shows if probabilities are well-calibrated)
4. Threshold optimization plots (metrics vs threshold)
5. Enhanced confusion matrices (visual performance comparison)
6. Multi-metric model comparison charts

}

**Total: 10-12 minutes** for complete enhanced pipeline

## Usage Recommendations

### For Best Results
Run the full enhanced pipeline:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

Includes all models, full tuning, and generates all visualizations.

### For Quick Testing
Run the fast test pipeline:
```bash
python run_fast_pipeline.py
```

Excludes SVM, uses reduced tuning. Good for verifying code changes.

### For Production Deployment

Based on results, recommended models:

**Option 1: XGBoost (Best F1-Score)**
- Use when balanced precision/recall is important
- Fast prediction times
- Good generalization

**Option 2: LightGBM Tuned (Best ROC-AUC)**
- Use when ranking by probability is needed
- Fastest training and prediction
- Highest discrimination ability

**Option 3: Stacking Ensemble (Most Robust)**
- Use when prediction stability is critical
- Combines multiple models
- Good overall performance

## Troubleshooting

**Pipeline takes too long:**
- Run `run_fast_pipeline.py` instead (excludes SVM)
- Reduce `TUNING_CONFIG['n_trials']` in config.py
- Disable tuning: `TUNING_CONFIG['enable_tuning'] = False`

**Memory issues:**
- Reduce number of models in MODEL_CONFIG
- Reduce n_estimators for Random Forest
- Close other applications

**Import errors:**
- Make sure virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)

## Backward Compatibility

The enhanced pipeline is fully backward compatible:

- Original basic pipeline still works: `main_basic()`
- Original files unchanged (only additions)
- Basic models still available
- No breaking changes to existing code

Both pipelines can be run independently:
```python
from src.main import main_basic, main_enhanced

# Run basic pipeline
basic_results = main_basic()

# Run enhanced pipeline
enhanced_results = main_enhanced()
```

## Future Improvements

Possible next steps:
- Add deep learning models (neural networks)
- Implement SMOTE or other balancing techniques
- Add feature importance analysis
- Create prediction API endpoint
- Add model monitoring and drift detection
- Implement A/B testing framework

All enhancements maintain clean code structure, comprehensive documentation, and professional coding practices.
